MTG Life Counter and Card Search Mobile iOS App

I was always interested with mobile app development and my love for the "Magic the Gathering: Commander" format
gave me the oppertunity to create something that I would regularly enjoy using.

The app itself has two parts: the first is the life counter and the card search.

Since the MTG: Commander format is usually played with four players, the main app screen has four boxes in each corner
representing each player. The default life is set to 40 and users can click the "+" or "-" images inside each box to increment
or decrement their life totals.

The second feature can be accessed by pressing the magnifying image located near the center of the main app screen. This brings
the user to the card search feature where users are able to type on a search box. I used the scryfall API to gain access to
jSon data containing card information such as card name, image, description, etc.

More features will be coming in the future and I really enjoy learning about Swift and Xcode in general.
If you have Xcode, feel free to download and play around with it.
